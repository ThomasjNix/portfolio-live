		 		<p>I am excited to say that this version of my portfolio utilizes (nearly) a full web stack! Here are some of the back-end technologies I used in this project, and how I used them:</p>
		 		<ul>
		 			<li>NodeJS + ExpressJS: Building a server, routing paths, loading assets, and creating RESTful routes</li>
		 			<li>MongoDB + MongooseJS: Loading skills and projects from a database (mLab) using CRUD operations</li>
		 			<li>EJS: Loading in the skills and projects dynamically</li>
		 			<li>PassportJS: Setting up an admin route with authentication so I can add skills and projects to my portfolio from the web</li>
		 		</ul>
