<h1>Major Update!</h1>
<p>This portfolio is now LIVE! Through Digital Ocean, Google Domains, SSH and a little magic, you can now visit this project at <a href="www.thomasjnix.com">thomasjnix.com</a>!</p>

<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<p>This is a repository intended for the development process of the next stage of my portfolio, where I will be incorporating back-end development and eventually deploying it to a live server! 
I have a few previous portfolio attemps from various points in my development experience, and the most recent before this one can be seen here: </p>

<h3>Why a new portfolio?</h3>

<p>I am striving to be a full-stack developer, and I feel that my portfolio needs to reflect that. Not to mention, my current portfolio is pretty... unappealing. That is because it was made early on in my development
learning process, and only had minimal use of proper CSS styling. After spending a lot of time learning more about front end as well as back end, I am looking forward to building a more functional and visually appealing 
portfolio to broadcast my skills!</p>

<h3>What to expect</h3>

<p>I have a small list of technologies I expect to use in this project, and of course this will likely be updated as I come across new information. Here is my current list:</p>

<ul style="list-style: none;">
    <li>
        HTML
    </li>
    <li>
        <ul>
            <li>EJS</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        CSS
    </li>
    <li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <del>Bootstrap (v3, possibly v4)</del> Semantic UI
            </li>
            <li>
                SASS (<em>Update: SASS to be used in next portfolio upgrade</em>)
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        JS
    </li>
    <li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                jQuery
            </li>
            <li>
                Grunt or Gulp  (<em>Update: Gulp to be used in next portfolio upgrade</em>)
            </li>
            <li>
                Angular or React  (<em>Update: Angular4 to be used in next portfolio upgrade</em>)
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        NodeJS
    </li>
    <li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                ExpressJS
            </li>
            <li>
                Possibly AuthenticateJS or PassportJS
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        MongoDB
    </li>
    <li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                MongooseJS
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

</ul>

<p>As is seen here, this is going to be a MEAN stack project. I am learning the MEAN stack because I enjoy JavaScript, and this portfolio should be a testament to that. I don't expect it to be completed
any time soon, as I am still in the process of learning and practicing these technologies as I write this. However, I have a good idea of where I am going, so the best thing to do is just to get started!</p>

<h3>Layout / Planning</h3>

<p>There is a lot to consider in this project, especially as far as front end design choices go, so this section will need to be updated over time.</p>

<h4>Front End</h4>
<ul>
<li>Responsive to mobile</li>
<li>Aesthetic styling</li>
<li>Consistent color palette (Not yet decided)</li>
<li>Interactive event handling (dropdown lists, hover effects, animations, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Back End</h4>
<ul>
<li>RESTful Routing</li>
<li>CRUD Database operations</li>
<li>Admin authetnication for database management</li>
<li>Support for single-page rendering (apps, see below) and multi-page rendering</li>
</ul>

<h4>Routing specific</h4>
<ul>
<li>Main page, including biography, skills section, and contact information</li>
<li>Access to project examples hosted live through any page visited</li>
<li>POST/PUT/DELTE requests available to admin, redirection for non-admin (or 403 page)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Database</h4>
<ul>
<li>Dynamically load/store content</li>
<li>Be able to render content from database to avoid manual additions (ex: skill page, adding a new skill via admin POST or PUT route)</li>
<li>Possibly load project routing via database storage? Could make adding a new project as simple as adding it to the database and providing a relative path, then rendering in all project paths in a drop down</li>
</ul>


<p>The takeaway here is that this is just an initial idea, and is certainly subject to change. It is a good starting point though! I look forward to creating, updating, and maintaining this page as I grow as a developer.</p>
